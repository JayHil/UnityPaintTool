# UnityPaintTool
A quick demo/proof of a paint tool in unity. Originally this was in an attempt to replicate the effect seen in Scanner Sombre: https://store.steampowered.com/app/475190/Scanner_Sombre/
However, I realized that this would be better accomplished with something like Unity's Gizmos or small spheres, since texture editing overcomplicates keeping track of 
the "age" of scans. I think this project could be well adapted to another project.
